    "You've just gone over how the SpecParam algorithm works on a single time-signal. However, most analyses usually include multiple electrodes and multiple conditions. Therefore, in this notebook, we'll simulate some data representing multiple epochs/trials from a single electrode and a single patient. Now, we can use \"fooofgroup\" to run the model on multiple power spectra within one function/fit. This will significantly speed up your coding and analysis. "

    "We suggest having your data in the time-domain in a 2D structure, in which each row represents a trial, and each column a time-point. Then, the power spectra can be created using the NeuroDSP library (which you have used earlier in this workshop). This will convert the data from the time-domain into the frequency-domain. Now the power spectra will also be in a 2D structure, in which each row still represents a trial, but each column now represents a frequency. This 2D structure can be used as input for the \"fooofgroup\" model.\n",
